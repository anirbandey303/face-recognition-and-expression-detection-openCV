# Face Recognition and Facial Expression Detection with TensorFlow and openCV

This model is capable of detecting face expressions and also recognise faces.
We're using Python

## Getting Started

Download the ZIP file or Clone this repository from you Command Prompt or Terminal

```
$git clone https://github.com/anirbandey303/face-recognition-and-expression-detection-openCV.git
```

### Prerequisites
Make sure these are installed on your computer.
* Python 3.7
* TensorFlow
* openCV
* Keras

### Installing

Install Python3.
To start off we will install Python3.

1. Open up the Terminal (Applications > Accessories > Terminal).

2. Copy/Paste the following line of code into Terminal and then press enter:
```
$ sudo apt-get install python3
```
3. The Terminal will then ask you for you're password, type it and then press enter.
4. Check installation with
```
$ python --version
```

Install TensorFlow
```
$ pip install tensorflow
```

Install Keras.
```
$ pip install --upgrade keras==2.2.4
```

Install openCV
```
$ pip install opencv-python
```

## Running the model

If you have installed all the required packages, you're ready to run the model.
Go to the required directory
```
$ cd face-recognition-and-expression-detection-openCV
```
```
$ cd src
```
```
$ python face_detection_t_v2.py
```

## Built With
